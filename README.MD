This is the readme for my first program in C. 
To get this project off the ground, I want to start off with simple user input parsing. 
Once I have this code working with two numbers and a sign, I will progress. 
At first I will use the basic signs that are available in C. 
I will then knock these down and use as few signs as possible. 
I want to determine if I can use bit manipulation to do this more quickly than with the signs. Or alternatively, understand the c language well enough to implement how the back end would do multiplication etc. 
Eventually I would like to get this project out of the CLI, at which point this likely changes scope.
